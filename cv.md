  ***

> My trip to the US almost 3 years ago changed my mindset about communicating with people in a language you are not fluent. That helped me not to care about mistakes I make but to concentrate more on the subect itself.
>
> I practiced **_English_** almost all day for the last few years but the most valuable experience for improving my English was my Erasmus echange in two different countries where I had to study and communicate with people around only in **_English_** for more than a year.
